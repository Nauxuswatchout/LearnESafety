            <h3>Keep private information private</h3>
            <p>
              Never share your full name, address, phone number, school name, or
              financial information online, especially in public forums or with
              people you don't know personally.

            <h3>Use strong, unique passwords</h3>
            <p>
              Create complex passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers,
              and symbols. Use different passwords for different accounts and
              change them regularly.

            <h3>Enable two-factor authentication</h3>
            <p>
              When available, enable two-factor authentication for an extra
              layer of security on important accounts.

          <li>
            <h3>Set up parental controls</h3>
            <p>
              Use built-in parental controls on devices, browsers, and
              applications to filter inappropriate content and limit screen
              time.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Keep devices in common areas</h3>
            <p>
              Encourage the use of computers, tablets, and other devices in
              shared family spaces rather than in bedrooms.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Establish clear rules</h3>
            <p>
              Create and discuss family internet rules, including time limits,
              appropriate websites and apps, and consequences for breaking
              rules.

            <h3>Be cautious with new online friends</h3>
            <p>
              Remember that people online may not be who they claim to be. Never
              meet someone in person whom you've only met online without parent
              supervision.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Think before posting</h3>
            <p>
              Once something is posted online, it can be difficult or impossible
              to remove. Consider how posts might affect your reputation or
              feelings of others.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Report inappropriate behavior</h3>
            <p>
              If someone is making you uncomfortable online, tell a trusted
              adult and report the behavior to the platform.

              If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be
              skeptical of free giveaways, prizes, or incredible deals.

              Hover over links to see where they actually lead before clicking.
              Don't open attachments or click links in emails from unknown
              senders.
