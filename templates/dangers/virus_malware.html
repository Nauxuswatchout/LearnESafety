      Malicious software that harms computers without permission. Viruses and
      Malware self-replicate and attach to files. These threats damage data,
      steal information, and compromise systems. Protection requires antivirus
      software, updates, and cautious digital habits.

          <h2>What are Viruses & Malware</h2>
          <p>
            Viruses and malware are malicious software designed to infiltrate
            and damage computers and other devices. Viruses are programs that
            can replicate themselves and spread from one device to another,
            while malware is a broader term that includes viruses and other
            harmful software like spyware, ransomware, and adware.
          </p>
          <p>
            These digital threats can compromise personal information, damage
            files, slow down devices, and even take control of systems. Children
            and teenagers are particularly vulnerable as they may not recognize
            suspicious links, downloads, or pop-ups that could contain malicious
            code.

            <p>
              Modern malware can be sophisticated and difficult to detect. Don't
              assume your devices are safe just because they appear to be
              functioning normally. Regular security checks and updates are
              essential.

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Disconnect from the internet</strong> - This prevents the
              malware from communicating with remote servers or spreading to
              other devices

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Update your security software</strong> - Ensure your
              antivirus has the latest definitions
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Run a full system scan</strong> - Let your security

            </li>

              <strong>Delete temporary files</strong> - Use your system's disk

            <li>
              <strong>Check for unusual programs</strong> - Remove any

              If you can't remove the malware, your system won't boot, or you're
