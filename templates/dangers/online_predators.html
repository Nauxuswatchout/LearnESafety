          <h2>What are Online Predators?</h2>
          <p>
            Online predators are individuals who use the internet to identify
            and groom potential victims, typically through flattery, sympathy,
            and by offering understanding or gifts. They may pose as peers or
            develop a false identity to build trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            These individuals often target vulnerable children and teenagers
            through social media platforms, online games, chat rooms, and
            messaging apps where they can establish private communications.

            <h3>Important Warning</h3>
            <p>
              Predators often spend weeks or months building relationships with
              children before attempting to arrange meetings or requesting
              inappropriate content. This "grooming" process makes it difficult
              for children to recognize the danger.

            <h3>Remember</h3>

              Reassure your child they are not in trouble. Many children
              hesitate to report suspicious interactions because they fear
              punishment or blame.
