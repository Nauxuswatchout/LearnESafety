          <h2>What is Inappropriate Content?</h2>
          <p>
            Inappropriate content refers to material not suitable for children
            including violent content, pornography, hate speech, drug use, and
            other adult themes that children may stumble upon while browsing the
            internet or using apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Children can encounter inappropriate content accidentally through
            web searches, pop-up ads, mistyped URLs, or through content shared
            by others. Some content may be harmful, upsetting, or confusing for
            children based on their age and maturity level.

              something concerning is just as important as prevention.
