          <h2>What is Online Addiction?</h2>
          <p>
            Online addiction refers to excessive use of digital devices, social
            media, video games, or other online activities to the point where it
            interferes with daily life, relationships, and emotional well-being.
            It's characterized by a compulsive need to use digital technology
            and difficulty controlling the amount of time spent online.
          </p>
          <p>
            Children and teenagers are particularly vulnerable to online
            addiction due to their developing brains, social pressures, and the
            intentionally engaging design of many apps and games that
            incorporate reward systems to encourage continued use.

            <h3>Important to Know</h3>
            <p>
              Digital addiction is increasingly recognized as a serious
              behavioral issue. While not yet officially classified as a
              disorder in most medical frameworks, its effects on mental health,
              academic performance, and social development are well-documented.

              If you notice several of these warning signs, approach the
              situation with empathy rather than criticism. Digital habits can
              be difficult to change, and a supportive approach is more
              effective than punishment.

            <h3>Balanced Approach</h3>
            <p>
              The goal isn't to eliminate technology but to foster a healthy
              relationship with it. Technology offers many benefits when used
              mindfully and in balance with other activities.

          <h2>Changing Activity Patterns</h2>
          <p>
            Data from Victorian surveys show concerning trends in how children
            spend their time. While screen use remains consistently high,
            participation in reading, creative activities, and physical play has
            declined significantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            These shifts in activity patterns can have profound impacts on
            development:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Physical Development</strong> - Reduced physical activity
              can affect motor skills, fitness, and overall health
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cognitive Development</strong> - Less reading and creative
              play may impact language skills and problem-solving abilities
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Social Development</strong> - Fewer in-person interactions
              can affect emotional intelligence and social skills
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mental Health</strong> - Imbalanced activities may
              contribute to increased stress and reduced wellbeing

            Rather than fighting technology, focus on teaching skills for

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Self-Regulation</strong> - Gradually teach children to
              monitor and manage their own screen time
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Critical Thinking</strong> - Encourage evaluation of

            <li>
              <strong>Mindful Consumption</strong> - Promote active, purposeful

            <li>
              <strong>Tech-Life Balance</strong> - Demonstrate that technology
