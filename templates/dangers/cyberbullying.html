          <h2>What is Cyberbullying?</h2>
          <p>
            Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place over digital devices like
            cell phones, computers, and tablets. It can occur through SMS, text,
            apps, online games, or social media platforms where people can view,
            participate in, or share content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cyberbullying includes sending, posting, or sharing negative,
            harmful, false, or mean content about someone else. It can include
            sharing personal or private information about someone else causing
            embarrassment or humiliation.

            <h3>Important to Know</h3>
            <p>
              Unlike traditional bullying, cyberbullying can happen 24 hours a
              day, 7 days a week, and can reach a child even when alone.
              Messages and images can be posted anonymously and distributed
              quickly to a wide audience.

          <h2>Impact of Cyberbullying</h2>
          <p>
            The effects of cyberbullying can be far-reaching and long-lasting:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Emotional Impact</strong> - Victims may experience
              depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and feelings of
              helplessness.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Social Impact</strong> - Children may withdraw from
              friends and family, avoid school, and lose interest in activities
              they once enjoyed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Academic Impact</strong> - Studies show that bullied
              children often experience a decline in school performance and
              attendance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Physical Health</strong> - Stress from bullying can lead
              to headaches, stomach issues, sleep problems, and other physical
              symptoms.
