        <h2>What are Phishing & Online Scams?</h2>
        <p>
          Phishing is a type of online scam where criminals send deceptive
          messages designed to trick people into revealing sensitive information
          or installing malicious software. These attacks often disguise
          themselves as trustworthy entities such as banks, social media
          platforms, or well-known companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          For children and teenagers, phishing can occur through fake gaming
          websites, social media messages, free gift offers, or even fake
          messages that appear to be from friends or family members.
